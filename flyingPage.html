			I was introduced to aviation from a very young age.  My first flight lesson in a small plane took place before I even learned 
			to drive.  I received my Private Pilot License when I was 17 and have flown over 300 hours since then.  Learning to fly is a 
			large commitment, both in time and expense, but few other pursuits provide the freedom and satisfaction fo flying an airplane.  
			As a pilot, you must be well-versed in many topics, such as basic aerodynamics, mechanical systems, navigation, and weather.  
			Shown below is a sample of the weather report available to a pilot at most airports.
