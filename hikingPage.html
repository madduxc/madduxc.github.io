            <h2>Upper Lopez Canyon, California 1980s</h2>
            <p>This is a trip I took in my teenage years with friends. We made this trek at least twice,
                but even the participants are a little vague at this point. I have photographic evidence
                that one trip was with friends, but I also remember another trip with Steve S.</p>
            <p>Mileage: ~9 round trip. Elevation: unknown</p>

            <h2>Pine Ridge Trail, Ventana Wilderness Area, California December 31, 1985</h2>
            <p>The infamous trip with Erran that started out as a day trip and ended with a stay in the
                hospital. A late start from the Ventana State Park campground and up the trail past the turnout
                to Ventana Camp, where we stopped for an MRE lunch. By the time we found the turnout we had missed,
                it was getting dark. Approaching Bad Gulch, we could not see our hands in front of our faces.
                The emergency matches we had brought would not light and the candle wick was useless. When the
                trial made a turn to follow the contour of the mountain ... we did not. Our hike ended with a 90
                foot fall down a cliff into Bad Gulch and onto a 45 degree slope. We were found the next day by a
                pair of trail runner who were looking for their sister who had gone missing on the same trail.
                Rescue came 12 hours later and ended for both of us with extensive injuries and a long hospital stay.
            </p>
            <p>Mileage: ~ 5 one-way. Elevation: unknown</p>
            <!-- We took no pictures of this trip or the subsequent result. News stories exist, but are hard to find-->

            <h2>Pine Ridge Trail, Ventana Wilderness Area, California 1994</h2>
            <p>A return trip with Erran and his girlfriend. This time we actually made Ventana Camp and hiked
                back out the next day - stopping at Bad Gultch.</p>
            <p>Mileage: 10 round trip. Elevation: +/-1,180 ft</p>

            </p>

            <h2>Noble Canyon/Pine Creek Trail, California 1995</h2>
            <p>Another partial trip in which I tried to stitch together two trips 10-15 miles each. The first leg
                started near Mt. Laguna (east of San Diego in Cleveland National Forest) and ended north of I-8, where
                I spent the night. The next day along the Pine Creek Trail, I hurt my knee and had to pull out.</p>
            <p>Mileage: ~12 one-way. Elevation: unknown</p>

            <h2>Pine Ridge Trail, Ventana Wilderness Area, California 1996</h2>
            <p>A 10th anniversary hike back to Ventana Camp, this one started out on Friday evening for what would
                be my first intentional night hike. This trip included a zero in VC before hiking out on Sunday. A stop
                in Bad Gultch was obligatory.</p>
            <p>Mileage: 10 round trip. Elevation: +/-1,180 ft<br>

            <h2>Rae Lakes Loop, Kings Canyon National Park, California Oct. 1996</h2>
            <p>My first big hike. This epic trip from the floor of Kings Canyon road's end (elev. 5,000 ft.) to the
                top of Glen Pass (elev. 11,982 ft.) over four days and three nights would be my longest and most
                difficult
                hike for decades.</p>
            <p>Mileage: 45 loop Elevation: +/-7,000 ft

            <h2>Hamilton Lake, Sequoia Nation Park, California Oct. 1997</h2>
            <p>Another attempt at epic miles, this one fell short. What started as a 55 mile loop trail ended in
                Hamilton Lake short of Kahwea Gap after a lightning storm changed my mind about the trip. It still
                became
                my second-longest trip at over 16 miles each way. Trip included a night at Bearpaw Meadow near the High
                Sierra Camp and a view of the alpineglow reflecting off of the Great Western Divide.</p>
            <p>Mileage: 34 round trip. Elevation: +/-6,500 ft.

            <h2>Wind Gap to Delware Water Gap, Pennsylvania May 2001</h2>
            <p>My first backpacking trip while dating Connie. We did an overnight hiking along the Appalachian Trial.
                Lots of rocks on this trip that stayed under the canopy of the "green tunnel" for the entire trip.</p>
            <p>Mileage: 15 one-way. Elevation: +/-850 ft.

            <h2>Lassen Nation Park, California 2002?</h2>
            <p>This is more of a placeholder for a largely forgotten trip. It was in Lassen. I made chicken 'n
                dumplings.
                We got sick. Rough trip.</p>

            <h2>Round Top, Fourth of July Lake, California Jul. 2003</h2>
            <p>We have a videotape of this trip that needs to be transferred off of 9mm. It started with me forgetting
                my
                hiking boots and subsequently hiking in sandals for the three days we were out. Not a lot of solid
                figures
                on
                this one. Camp Irene Trail to Summit City Canyon Trail to Pacific Crest Trail. Last trip before Julia
                was
                born.</p>
            <p>Mileage: 16 loop Elevation: 3,300 ft

            <h2>Cobalt Lake, Glacier National Park, Montana Aug. 2011</h2>
            <p>This was our first trip since having Julia and our first trip with her along.This was an alternate
                because
                of bear activity in our intended destination. Interestingly, we saw a young Grizzly on our trip anyway.
                Cobalt Lake was a beautiful destination and we saw mountain goats in the cliffs above our campsite. The
                trip
                was
                supposed to be 3 days, but I was only good for two. it would be my last overnighter for eight years.</p>
            <p>Mileage: 11.6 round trip Elevation: +/-1,400 ft

            <h2>Spectacle Lake, Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Washington Aug 2019</h2>
            <p>Solo overnight trip that started out as a "we'll see" and ended up working out pretty well. After a long
                summer
                of testing my limits, this became an opportunity to push them. The lake was beautiful and lit the fire
                necessary
                to begin working toward more trips in the coming years.</p>
            <p>Mileage: 22 round trip Elevation: +/-1,300 ft

            <h2>Boardman Lake, Washington Sep 2019</h2>
            <p>Short trip with the whole family (including the dogs) to a pretty little lake in the woods.</p>

            <h2>Waptus Lake, Deep Lake, Pacific Crest Trail, Washington Jul 2020</h2>
            <p>This trip came on the heals of a failed attempt to traverse the PCT "J section". After snow prevented me
                from
                starting at Steven's Pass and a weekend regroup, led to the second-longest trip to date and beautiful
                solo
                night
                at Deep Lake. Three nights total.</p>
            <p>Mileage: 35 round trip Elevation: +/-3,150 ft

            <h2>Chinook Pass to Goat Rocks (Walupt Lake), Pacific Crest Trail, Washington Aug 2020</h2>
            <p>The big one. My longest trip to date. This began as a trip with Ian from the Chinook Pass trailhead along
                the Pacific Crest Trail southbound. We made it together the 30 miles to White Pass before Ian had to say
                goodbye.
                After that I continued solo through Goat Rocks Wilderness and across the fabulous Knife's Edge before
                crossing
                Cispus Pass and exiting via Walupt Lake. Six days total.</p>
            <p>Mileage: 63 one way Elevation: +/-10,700 ft

            <h2>Park Butte, Mount Baker National Forest, Washington Sep 2020</h2>
            <p>Overnight trip with Connie to the lookout tower at base of Mount Baker. Beautiful campsite in the shadow
                of
                the mountain with views all the way to the Sound. Heard the crashing of ice from the glaciers (like the
                sound of
                thunder) late in the evening and had a beautiful sunset before bed.</p>
